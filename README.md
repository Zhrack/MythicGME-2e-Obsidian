# MythicGME-2e-Obsidian
A starter vault to use Mythic GME 2e by Tana Pigeon in Obsidian.

At the moment only the Meaning Elements Tables are included, it will probably grow with time.

## Change log

### v4.0
- merged PR for alternate table view of Meaning Tables.
### v3.1
- Fixed Descriptions second roller rolling on first table instead of second.
### v3.0
- Removed number columns to have cleaner output.
- Removed dice rollers in single files.
### v2.0
- Added a note hosting all rollers for ease of use.
### v1.0
- Uploaded Meaning Tables.

## Setting up
Just download this repository as a zip file and unzip it in your chosen folder.
Create an Obsidian Vault from that folder and have fun!

To use the automatic table roller, the plugin [Dice Roller](https://github.com/valentine195/obsidian-dice-roller) is needed.
Once installed and activated, just keep the Obsidian pane in Reading mode and click on the result text to reroll.
